# Infrastructure

This is the Infrastructure layer in our Domain Driven Design(DDD) architecture

It handles how the data that is initially held in domain entities (in memory) and persisted in our sqflite database.
The connectivity helper that checks for internet connection an all the API endpoints that connect to our servers are also found in this layer.
